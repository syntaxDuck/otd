Great question! Your current hash table implementation is solid, but there are several additional features and improvements that you could consider adding. Here are some ideas for expanding and enhancing the functionality of your hash table library:

### **1. Resize the Hash Table (Rehashing)**

Over time, as you add more elements to your hash table, the likelihood of collisions increases, which can degrade performance. A useful feature to implement is **rehashing** or **resizing** the hash table when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 0.75).

- **What to do**: When the number of entries exceeds a certain threshold, create a new larger hash table, rehash all existing entries, and move them to the new table.

```c
void ht_resize(HashTable *table, size_t new_size) {
    HashTable *new_table = ht_create(table->hash_type, new_size);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < table->size; i++) {
        Entry *entry = table->buckets[i];
        while (entry) {
            ht_insert(new_table, entry->key, entry->val);
            entry = entry->next;
        }
    }
    // Free old hash table
    free_ht(table);
    table = new_table;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- Improves performance by reducing the number of collisions when the table grows too large.
- Keeps the operations on average `O(1)` for insertions and lookups even as the table grows.

---

### **2. Support for Custom Hash Functions**

Right now, your library only supports the DJB2 hash function. You can extend the library to support **custom hash functions** passed by the user, allowing the hash table to be more flexible.

- **What to do**: Add a function that allows users to set their custom hash function at runtime.

```c
void ht_set_hash_function(HashTable *table, unsigned long (*hash_func)(const char *, size_t)) {
    table->hash_func = hash_func;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- This gives users more control over the hashing mechanism, allowing them to experiment with different algorithms that might be more suited for their use cases.

---

### **3. Find the Size of the Table**

Another useful addition is a function that returns the current **number of elements** in the hash table. This can be helpful for various operations like checking load factors, dynamically resizing the table, or just debugging.

```c
size_t ht_size(HashTable *table) {
    size_t count = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < table->size; i++) {
        Entry *entry = table->buckets[i];
        while (entry) {
            count++;
            entry = entry->next;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- Provides a way to track the current load of the hash table, which is useful for deciding when to resize it or assess its efficiency.

---

### **4. Check if a Key Exists**

Sometimes, you may want to quickly check if a key exists without retrieving its value. This can be useful for operations like validation, conditional insertions, or removals.

```c
bool ht_contains(HashTable *table, const char *key) {
    Entry *entry = ht_get_entry(table, key);
    return entry != NULL;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- It’s a straightforward function that checks whether a key exists, making it easier to add logic like “insert if not exists” or “remove only if exists.”

---

### **5. Clear the Hash Table**

You can add a function to **clear all entries** in the hash table. This would reset the hash table to an empty state without needing to deallocate the entire structure.

```c
void ht_clear(HashTable *table) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < table->size; i++) {
        Entry *entry = table->buckets[i];
        while (entry) {
            Entry *next = entry->next;
            free_entry(entry);
            entry = next;
        }
        table->buckets[i] = NULL;
    }
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- Allows you to efficiently clear the table without deallocating and recreating the hash table, which could be more expensive than just removing all entries.

---

### **6. Implement Iterator Functions**

An iterator for the hash table would allow you to iterate through all the entries without needing to manage the current state manually.

- **What to do**: Implement an iterator function that returns the next entry in the hash table each time it’s called.

```c
Entry *ht_next(HashTable *table, size_t *bucket_index, Entry **entry) {
    if (*entry == NULL) {
        // Move to the next bucket
        while (++(*bucket_index) < table->size) {
            *entry = table->buckets[*bucket_index];
            if (*entry) break;
        }
    } else {
        *entry = (*entry)->next;
    }
    return *entry;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- Makes it easier to traverse the hash table for operations like printing or applying a function to all keys/values.

---

### **7. Support for Multiple Data Types (Generics)**

Currently, your hash table only supports `char*` types for keys and values. Adding support for generic data types would make your library more versatile.

- **What to do**: Use `void*` for keys and values, and store their sizes so that you can handle different data types.

```c
typedef struct Entry {
    void *key;
    void *val;
    size_t key_size;
    size_t val_size;
    struct Entry *next;
} Entry;

void ht_insert(HashTable *table, void *key, size_t key_size, void *val, size_t val_size) {
    unsigned long index = ht_get_index(table->hash_type, key, table->size);
    Entry *entry = malloc(sizeof(Entry));
    entry->key = malloc(key_size);
    memcpy(entry->key, key, key_size);
    entry->key_size = key_size;

    entry->val = malloc(val_size);
    memcpy(entry->val, val, val_size);
    entry->val_size = val_size;

    entry->next = table->buckets[index];
    table->buckets[index] = entry;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- This allows the hash table to handle any data type, making it far more flexible and reusable in a variety of scenarios.

---

### **8. Implement Key/Value Destruction Callbacks**

It might be useful to provide the option for users to supply their own cleanup functions for keys and values. This could be useful in cases where keys or values are dynamically allocated and need specific clean-up.

```c
typedef void (*free_func)(void*);

void ht_set_free_func(HashTable *table, free_func free_key, free_func free_value) {
    table->free_key = free_key;
    table->free_value = free_value;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- Allows custom memory management strategies, especially when dealing with more complex data types that require special deallocation (e.g., if you're storing dynamically allocated structures).

---

### **9. Implement Load Factor Check**

You could introduce a function to check the **load factor** of the hash table (i.e., how full the table is). This would help decide when to rehash and optimize the table.

```c
float ht_load_factor(HashTable *table) {
    size_t num_elements = ht_size(table);
    return (float)num_elements / table->size;
}
```

**Why it's useful**:

- Helps track how full the table is, giving insights into whether resizing or rehashing is needed to maintain efficient performance.

---

### **10. Thread Safety (Optional, Advanced)**

If you're working in a multi-threaded environment, making your hash table **thread-safe** (e.g., using mutexes) could be a necessary feature, especially when performing operations like insertion and removal.

---

### Summary of Ideas:

- 1. **Resize/Rehash** – Dynamically resize the hash table when it becomes too full.

- 2. **Custom Hash Functions** – Allow users to define their own hash functions.

- 3. **Size Tracking** – Add a function to return the current number of entries in the table.

- 4. **Key Existence Check** – Quickly check if a key exists in the table.

- 5. **Clear Function** – Efficiently clear the table without deallocating it.

6. **Iterator** – Implement an iterator to traverse the table.
7. **Generics Support** – Allow storing different data types (using `void*`).
8. **Custom Cleanup Functions** – Allow users to define custom cleanup logic for keys/values.

- 9. **Load Factor Monitoring** – Keep track of the table’s load factor.

10. **Thread Safety** – Consider adding thread safety if you're working in a multi-threaded environment.
