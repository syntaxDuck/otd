### Hash Map Todo:

- 1. **Resize/Rehash** – Dynamically resize the hash table when it becomes too full.

- 2. **Custom Hash Functions** – Allow users to define their own hash functions.

- 3. **Size Tracking** – Add a function to return the current number of entries in the table.

- 4. **Key Existence Check** – Quickly check if a key exists in the table.

- 5. **Clear Function** – Efficiently clear the table without deallocating it.

6. **Iterator** – Implement an iterator to traverse the table.
7. **Generics Support** – Allow storing different data types (using `void*`).
8. **Custom Cleanup Functions** – Allow users to define custom cleanup logic for keys/values.

- 9. **Load Factor Monitoring** – Keep track of the table’s load factor.

10. **Thread Safety** – Consider adding thread safety if you're working in a multi-threaded environment.

### Password Manager Todo:

- Finish write vault routine
- Finish read vault routine
- Implement adding and removing password from vaults
